      The data on this website is based on the data released by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on donations that were made during the
       
      2017-2018 and 2019-2020
       election cycles. Only donations exceeding $200 in value are required to be publicly disclosed, i.e. (multiple) donations below $200 threshold do not need to be itemized.
